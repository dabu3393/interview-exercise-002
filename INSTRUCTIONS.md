# INSTRUCTIONS

This is a little exercise to help you get a feel for what would be asked of you and to give us an idea of where you are at comfort level wise.  Some of the steps below will be very basic and it should theoretically ramp to more challenging tasks.  The intent is not necessarily to finish this, an hour or so at most should be spent on it.  You are welcome to choose the language of your choice for the steps below.  Python or Golang would be uiltized in day to day but that is just FYI, you are welcome to choose whatever you are most comfortable with.  Also, just as it would be in a normal day to day feel free to use the internet as you need, this is not supposed to be something you are just doing from memory.

# STEPS

## SETUP
1. Clone this repo to your local environment
2. Create a work branch for yourself
3. Create a new file called NOTES.md to write down anything you learn, have questions about, or think is worth otherwise noting as you go along!
4. Commit your file to your local branch and push it to the origin repository.

## STEP ONE: LOCATION INFO 
1. Pull location information for a zip code (your zip code, some place you want to visit, whatever!) from https://www.zippopotam.us/
2. Extract the latitude and longitude information for the place you have chosen
3. Print that information to stdout
4. Commit your changes and push to the origin repository

## STEP TWO: WEATHER DATA
1. We are going to use the location information from STEP ONE to query for weather from 7timer.  Docs: http://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en
3. Pull JSON data from the ASTRO API for the location you choose in STEP ONE
4. Print the Cloud Cover percentage for this day for your choosen location

Don't forget to write a couple quick notes about the exercise in NOTES.md!  Were parts too hard, to easy, were there parts you knew once but had forgotten, did you learn something new, etc.?  Good luck!
